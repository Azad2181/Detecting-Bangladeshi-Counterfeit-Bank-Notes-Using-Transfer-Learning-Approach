# Detecting Bangladeshi Counterfeit Bank Notes Using Transfer Learning Approach

## Introduction:
Counterfeit money is currency produced without the legal approval of the government. Counterfeit currency is a threat to economic weakness of the country. In the context of Bangladesh, fake money looks like real money. It has become very difficult to identify which is genuine and which is fake. The current methods of detecting fake money in banks are very expensive but it is not possible for common people to always use it or to carry it from one place to another. In this paper we have proposed a transfer learning based model of fake money detection. Fake notes of 500 and 1000tk are widely used in Bangladesh. Here, we have completed the test on Bangladeshi 500 and 1000 Tk. We used different architecture of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm. We are found different accuracies. All the result are compared in some evolution matrices. 

## Objectives:
To propose a model that can classify fake and real Bangladeshi currency with good accuracy. To detect fake currency easily. Verifying the authenticity of money by using a mobile app. Identifying bank notes correctly from both sides by inspecting the color, design features and specific data of currency.  

## Method And Materialâ€˜s:
There are used Bangladeshi bank notes image dataset which are collected from M Shorif et.al.There are 12 counterfeit notes and 70 real notes. After augmentation image has increased  12 to 108 and 70 to 630.

## Conclusions:
We are the first to use CNN to detect counterfeit Bangladeshi bank notes. We found the highest Test Accuracy of 98.67% in the VGG16 model. Rigorous testing with diverse situations of currencies is required for full validation of the proposed approach that will be our future work. In our dataset, we have taken Bangladeshi notes of 500 and 1000 taka, so the authenticity of any note other than 500 and 1000 taka cannot be verified. We will try to increase the Accuracy by using more methods in the future.
